**BeanKind** is a purpose-driven coffee brand landing page.

Its goal is to:
- communicate brand values
- engage users emotionally
- convert interest into action

This landing page is designed as a **communication tool**, not just a website.

## Why a Landing Page?

A landing page allows:
- a **focused narrative**
- a clear **call to action**

## Technical Stack

- **JavaScript** for interaction and dynamic behavior

No external frameworks were used to demonstrate full control of the basics.

## Semantic HTML Structure

- logical content hierarchy
- accessibility-oriented markup

## Responsive Design (CSS)

The layout is fully responsive thanks to:
- Flexbox and Grid
- media queries

The same landing page adapts smoothly from desktop to smartphone.

## Visual Consistency with CSS Variables

Colors are managed through **CSS variables**:
- easy theme control
- scalable design system
- prepared for dynamic changes

This makes the design flexible and future-proof.

## Interactive Elements (JavaScript)

JavaScript is used to enhance user experience:
- testimonial carousel
- hamburger menu on mobile
- dynamic UI behavior

Interactions are subtle and functional, never intrusive.

It is not just a website, but a **communication product**.
